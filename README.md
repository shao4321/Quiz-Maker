### Improvements

1. Aesthetics and design of the app
2. Make the app become live of which users can login simultaenously and sync all contents with one another.

### Technologies

1. Tkinter
2. SQLite

> Before I started branching into web development, this was an amazing technology for me to build my first application due to Python being my first programming language. Tkinter does not have a steep learning curve and provides me with an essential skillset to build an application.

> As I needed a database to manage and store quite a few files of data, SQLite being a compact library has enough space for it.
